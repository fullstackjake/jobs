# Backend Software Engineer: C

[Emcien](http://emcien.com/) is looking for an experienced software engineer
with a focus on C development to help build and improve our analytics engine. We work at the intersections of graph theory, information
theory, statisitcs and machine learning, which lends to exciting and
challenging problems to solve on a daily basis. We hire engaged and
hard-working engineers who are open to learning complex concepts. We care about
doing things the right way and take pride in our code.

Emcien develops two products ([Scan](http://emcien.com/scan/) &
[Patterns](http://emcien.com/patterns/)) based on a patented pattern-detection
engine. Using the mathematical concept of sparse matrix graphs, we build
applications solving a diverse set of interesting business analytics problems.

As a software engineer, your day-to-day work is a balance of software
engineering and data science. Your work will range from:

* **Whiteboarding and Conceptual Discussions** where we wrestle through ideas
  like conditional probability and prediction scoring. Time-on-whiteboard is
  mainly to flesh out ideas, bookmark good ones, and agree on next steps. These
  topics will be typically led by our founder and [Chief Scientist, Dr. Roy
  Marsten](http://emcien.com/about/#leadership) who drives the algorithmic
  development. This role will work closely with Dr. Marsten to translate the
  research prototypes into production code.

* **Writing Code** in our analytics engine. Since we own our codebase for the
  long haul, we have an intense focus on code smell, refactoring, pair
  programming, and product excellence. While we have high individual standards,
  we work closely as a team to share ideas, mentor, and train. We have weekly
  deep-dives into engineering topics, sanctioned side-project time, and
  participate in meetups & hackathons.

* **Communicating Data Science Concepts** by closing the gap between science & user needs is one of the most rewarding
  aspects of our work. This role does not have direct contact with user
  interfaces, but the results from our analyitcal engine need to align with the
  customer experience.

* **Ruthless [Bumperpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_pool) Matches**,
  where we take breaks from our hard work for some light competition against
  our peers. We have pushed the game with shots like 'around-the-worlds', 'tipper gores', and 'smash-n-pray'.

This work is both challenging and energizing. The payoff is hearing stories
from our customers explaining how Patterns, for example, helps solve problems
no other solution (R, SAS, Hadoop, etc.) has ever solved. And the icing is that
we often solve large problems in minutes, where modeling and map-reduce take
hours, if not days.

To see a small sample of our work, please take a look at some of our videos:

  * [Customer churn prevention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NywaC0EBAh8)


## Tools We Use

* **Git** for source control and versioning
* **Jira** for issue tracking and sprint management
* **C** for development on our analytics engine
* **Ruby on Rails**, **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** for serving a web
  application to present the results of our analysis
* **Linux**, **Amazon Web Services** and **Virtual Machines** for building
  and deploying our applications


## Skills & Requirements

* Solid working knowledge of C: understanding of concepts such as pointers,
  hash tables, memory management, data processing and macros
* Strong ability to grasp new and complex concepts in math, computer science
  and engineering
* Ownership of the product lifecycle from system design through deployment
* Strong communication skills and the ability to mentor other engineers in
  small teams
* Demonstrated experiencing delivering production ready code to customers
* Experience writing unit tests
* Comfortable on the linux command-line (beyond `ls` and `cd`)

## Nice to Have
* Familiarity with Ruby (our tests are written in Ruby with RSpec)
* Willingness to wear multiple hats; we own our operations infrastructure
  and all engineers take part in building and maintaining it
* Understanding of Linux systems, management and administration
* Comfortable exploring and assessing new technologies
* Thoughtful software design that minimizes technical debt and is built to
  last, not just fix the plumbing
* Basic understanding of core concepts in statistics and probability, maybe
  even Bayes' Theorem
* Interest in graph theory, information theory or machine learning


## To Apply

Please send your resume [devjobs@emcien.com](mailto:devjobs@emcien.com) along
with either of the following:

* Your answers to our [Backend Engineering Test](https://github.com/emcien/jobs/blob/master/tests/backend_test.md)

* A code sample in C: an open source project, a simple `cat` (or similar)
  utility, or 3 [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems from ID 15
  or higher

**Note:**

Emcien does not sponsor any Visas. All Engineers work out of our Atlanta Headquarters
