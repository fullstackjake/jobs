[Emcien](http://emcien.com/) is looking for a junior software engineer to help
build and improve our software and web applications. We work at the
intersections of graph theory, information theory, statistics and machine
learning, which lends to exciting and challenging problems to solve on a daily
basis. We hire engaged and hard-working engineers who are open to learning new
concepts and wearing multiple hats. We care about doing things the right way
and take pride in our code.

Emcien main product is [Patterns](http://emcien.com/patterns/)), based on our
patented pattern-detection engine. Using the mathematical concept of sparse
matrix graphs, we build applications solving a diverse set of interesting
business problems.

As a junior engineer, your day-to-day work is a balance of engineering
and data science. Your work will range from:

* *Writing Code* to fix defects or add enhancements to our Rails applications,
  front-end javascript, server configurations, or scripts used to help manage
  and process data. While we have high individual standards, we work closely as
  a team to share ideas, mentor, and train.

* *Supporting* non-technical teams throughout Emcien as they work to enable our
  customers to get up and running with our applications, including using our
  RESTful APIs.

* *Testing* our products with both manual tests and helping to write and execute
  automated test scripts. As a small team, all developers are responsible for
  the quality of our product.

* *Documenting* new features and improvements to our products.

In addition to the above, you can expect to participate in:

* **Whiteboarding and Conceptual Discussions** where we wrestle through ideas
  like conditional probability and prediction scoring. Time-on-whiteboard is
  mainly to flesh out ideas, bookmark good ones, and agree on next steps.

* **Communicating Data Science Concepts** by closing the gap between science &
  user needs is one of the most rewarding aspects of our work. How to we
  provide data, data access, and terminology that conveys Emcien's data science
  to non-technical customers.

* **Ruthless [Bumperpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumper_pool) Matches**,
  where we take breaks from our hard work for some light competition against
  our peers. We have pushed the game with shots like 'around-the-worlds',
  'tipper gores', and 'smash-n-pray'.

This work is both challenging and energizing. The payoff is hearing stories
from our customers explaining how Patterns, for example, solves problems
no other solution (R, SAS, Hadoop, etc.) has ever solved. And the icing is that
we often solve large problems in minutes, where modeling and map-reduce take
hours, if not days.

To see a small sample of our work, please take a look at some of our videos:

  * [Predictive Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3JhAuLDfJo)
  * [Predicting Supply Chain Delay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UOMpxci6e0)
  * [Predicting Machin Failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=na4RSwQT_DQ)

## Tools We Use

* **Git** for source control and versioning
* **Jira** for issue tracking and sprint management
* **Ruby on Rails**, **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** for serving a web
* **TravisCI, RSpec and Testrail** for testing the quality of our code
* **C** for development on our analytics engine application to present the
  results of our analysis
* **Linux**, **Amazon Web Services** and **Virtual Machines** for building and
  deploying our applications


## Skills & Requirements

* A basic understanding of how web servers work and how the frontend of an web
  application interacts with the backend
* Basic knowledge of front-end development languages: familiarity with HTML and
  maybe even CSS or JS
* Ability to work with data files (CSVs) in tools other than just Excel
* Comfortable on the linux command-line (beyond `ls` and `cd`)
* Willingness to wear multiple hats; all engineers are responsible for not just
  coding, but also testing, documenting and consuming our products


## Nice to Have

* Working knowledge of an object-oriented programming language
* Experience writing unit tests
* Experience with Ruby and possibly even Ruby on Rails
* Comfortable exploring and assessing new technologies
* Thoughtful software design that minimizes technical debt and is built to
  last, not just fix the plumbing
* Basic understanding of core concepts in statistics and probability, maybe
  even Bayes' Theorem
* Interest in graph theory, information theory or machine learning

## To Apply

Please send your resume [devjobs@emcien.com](mailto:devjobs@emcien.com) along
with either of the following:

* Your answers to our [Engineering Test](https://github.com/emcien/jobs/blob/master/tests/backend_test.md)

* A code sample in an object-oriented: an open source project, a simple "To Do" Rails app (or
  similar), or 3 [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems from ID 15
  or higher
