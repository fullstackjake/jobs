# Frontend Engineering test

Please download the data set
[disasters.csv](https://github.com/emcien/jobs/blob/master/tests/disasters.csv) that
contains information about natural disasters occuring in Georgia from 2010 to
2013.

Your task is to create a visualization from this data.

**Visualization goals:**

- To present the data in an interesting and fun way
- To make the data intuitive and easy to understand for the user
- To show off a little

We would like to see the code, and the app running somewhere if possible (you
can use sites like [codepen](http://codepen.io/) and
[jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/) to host it.)
